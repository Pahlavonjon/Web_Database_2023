        <h1>A page with some divs and spans</h1>
        <p>This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.</p>
        <p>Because this give is special, it has it's own id, "content"<br>
        This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background</p>
        <hr>
        <p>This is a normal paragraph, <span class="span_task5">except this span of text is blue</span><span class="span2_task5"> and this span has a font-family of cursive,</span> <br>
        because they belong to two classes called blue and cursive respectively.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, <span class="span3_task5">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>This text inside is a normal div, but the background has not been set.</p>
